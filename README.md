A national veteransâ€™ organization seeks to better target its solicitations for donation. By
soliciting only the most likely donors, less money is spent on solicitation efforts and more
money is available for charitable concerns. Solicitations involve sending a small gift to an
individual and include a request for a donation. Gifts to donors include mailing labels and
greeting cards.
